# ❄️ nixcfg

Welcome to my **nixcfg**!

This repository contains my Darwin, NixOS and home-manager configurations, along with whatever custom modules and packages they require. It is modular, declarative, and tailored for multi-device setups. Hopefully, it's as useful to you as it is to me!

## ✨ Features

- **Declarative System & Dotfiles:** Fully declarative management of my macOS (Darwin) + Linux installations and user environments (dotfiles, packages) using Flakes, NixOS, nix-darwin, and home-manager.
- **Multi-Host Configs:** Seamlessly configures my diverse hosts including bare-metal PCs, laptops (Framework, ThinkPad), mini-servers (Beelink), and virtual private servers (Hetzner, Netcup, AWS).
- **Secure Boot & Encryption:** Encrypted boot drives with Secure Boot via `lanzaboote` and automatic LUKS decryption using TPM.
- **Comprehensive Hardware Support:** Meticulously crafted configurations for my (sometimes unique) devices, including custom audio enhancements (Pipewire filter chains) and device-specific power optimizations.
- **Hybrid Cloud Services:** Declarative setup for all the hosts and services that make up my overly complicated homelab, including the \*arr stack, Audiobookshelf, Caddy, Forgejo (my Git forge), Grafana + Loki + Prometheus, Immich, Karakeep, self-hosted AI inference with Ollama, Plex, qBittorrent, Vaultwarden, and more.
- **Automatic Monitoring & Backups:** Easy Prometheus + Loki and Uptime-Kuma setups for system and service monitoring, plus automated Restic backups to Backblaze B2.
- **Robust Networking:** Secure and flexible networking with Tailscale (it's WireGuard), declarative WiFi profiles, and NFS/Samba sharing.
- **Productivity & Development:** Pre-configured tools for development (Git, Helix, VS Code, Zed), shell enhancements (fastfetch, oh-my-posh, zsh), etc.
<!-- - **System-Wide Theming:** Consistent aesthetics across devices with stylix, which auto-generates application themes from base16 color schemes. -->
